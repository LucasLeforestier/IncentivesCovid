# Covid-19 Vaccination Incentives in the US

As COVID-19 has emerged as the most widespread human pandemic disease in the
pandemic in the last century, the need to control its spread to avoid massive loss of life
to prevent a massive loss of human life has become more than necessary, and
and this in an extremely rapid way. Several vaccines were developed and
and the task of the political decision makers was suddenly to convince by different means the
by various means to convince the recalcitrant population to be vaccinated. When some countries have
chose a policy of mandatory vaccination or punitive incentives, many states in the United States
in the United States have adopted various incentives in an attempt to increase immunization
coverage. A study we conducted in recent months had
led to a quantification of the effect of these measures on the proportion of the population
population vaccinated, using the synthetic control method, by simulating what would have happened
without these measures. It is now necessary to generalize this study on smaller scales, to improve the results
scales, to improve the results of our previous study, to quantify their robustness and to
robustness and to provide a tool that policy makers can use to adapt their behavior in light of
their behavior in light of the results obtained.
